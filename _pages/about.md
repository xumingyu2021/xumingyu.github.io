I just graduated and started working in [Baichuan AI](https://www.baichuan-ai.com/home) this year. I obtained a master's degree in engineering from the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/). I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree from [the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/).

I am interested in large language models and machine learning. Welcome to discuss with me.

My resume (Chinese Version) is [here](../assets/cv_20241107.pdf). And my email is xumingyu2021@ia.ac.cn.
